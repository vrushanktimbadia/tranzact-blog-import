# Demand Management: Functions, Process, and Examples

**TL;DR:** Demand management helps manufacturers forecast, shape, and fulfill customer demand without excess inventory or missed orders. It aligns sales, production, and supply planning so operations stay predictable and cost-efficient.

## What Is Demand Management?
Demand management is the process of understanding, forecasting, and influencing customer demand so that supply, production, and inventory stay aligned. For manufacturers, it reduces uncertainty by anticipating demand changes and proactively addressing supply chain bottlenecks.

In manufacturing operations, demand management typically sits between supply chain execution and portfolio or project planning, ensuring cross-functional coordination across procurement, production, and sales.

## Objectives of Demand Management
The core objective of demand management is to improve demand predictability while balancing cost, capacity, and customer service.

### Accurate forecasting
Demand management analyzes historical sales data and buying patterns to forecast future demand more accurately.

### Optimal stock management and expenditures
Accurate demand forecasts help businesses avoid excess inventory and reduce unnecessary spending.

### Increased customer satisfaction
Aligned inventory levels reduce stockouts and backorders, improving fulfillment speed and customer experience.
