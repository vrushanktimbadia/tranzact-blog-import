# Intermittent Production

**TL;DR:** Intermittent production is a flexible manufacturing approach where products are made in small batches or custom orders with start–stop workflows, ideal for high-variety, low-volume manufacturing.

Intermittent production is a production approach where different products are manufactured on the same production line but at irregular intervals. It is commonly used when customer demand varies and customization is required.

## What Is Intermittent Production?

Intermittent production refers to a manufacturing method that operates in starts and stops rather than a continuous flow. It allows manufacturers to produce multiple product variants using the same resources, adjusting schedules based on customer orders.

This system supports high product variety and low production volumes, making it suitable for make-to-order and customization-heavy businesses.

## Features of Intermittent Production

- Produces goods in small batches or custom units
- Supports high product variety
- Uses flexible, general-purpose machinery
- Production flow is irregular
- Operations adapt based on customer demand

## Difference Between Intermittent and Continuous Production

| Criteria | Intermittent Production | Continuous Production |
|-------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Production trigger | Customer orders | Demand forecast |
| Flexibility | High | Low |
| Scale | Small batches | Large scale |
| Inventory | Minimal pre-planning | Inventory-driven |
| Cost per unit | Higher | Lower |

## Intermittent Production Methods

### Batch Manufacturing

Batch manufacturing produces goods in groups based on demand and resource availability. Products may undergo changes such as size or design variations between batches.

### Discrete Manufacturing

Discrete manufacturing involves assembling distinct components into finished products. Components are interchangeable and can be replaced or reconfigured.

### Job Shop Manufacturing

Job shop manufacturing focuses on highly customized products. Each job follows a unique route through the production floor depending on customer specifications.

## Intermittent Production Examples

- Bakeries and cake shops
- Custom machinery manufacturers
- Jewelry and goldsmith workshops

## Advantages of Intermittent Production

- Supports customization
- Efficient use of machinery
- Better quality focus
- Adaptable to design changes

## Disadvantages of Intermittent Production

- Longer lead times
- Higher process complexity
- Limited scalability
- Higher work-in-progress inventory

## FAQs

### What is intermittent production?
Intermittent production is a manufacturing method where products are made in small quantities with flexible scheduling based on customer orders.

### How is intermittent production different from continuous production?
Intermittent production is order-driven and flexible, while continuous production focuses on standardized, high-volume output.

### What are the main types of intermittent production?
The main types are batch manufacturing, discrete manufacturing, and job shop manufacturing.

### When should manufacturers use intermittent production?
It is best suited for low-volume, high-variety or customized manufacturing environments.

### Is intermittent production suitable for Indian SME manufacturers?
Yes, it works well for SMEs handling customization, limited capital, and fluctuating demand.
