## Define Semi-Finished Goods

Semi-finished goods are processed raw materials that still need further refinement before reaching the consumer. They allow companies to save time and speed up production rates.

## Understanding Semi-Finished Goods

Companies either buy or process raw materials into semi-finished goods. These goods might be raw materials for one industry but finished products for another.

## Production and Semi-Finished Goods

Economists exclude semi-finished goods when calculating Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to prevent double counting in the economy.

## Semi-Finished Goods in the Calculation of GDP

GDP accounts for the final product, not intermediate goods. For example, a farmer sells grains to an industry, which processes them into bread, each step adding value but not contributing separately to GDP.

## Examples of Semi-Finished Goods

### 1. Manufacturing

Automobile industries use steel sheets, while other industries use semi-finished goods as raw materials for production.

### 2. Baking

Bakeries use intermediate goods like sugar and yeast to produce baked goods.

### 3. Construction

Wood planks, steel structures, and plywood are considered semi-finished products in construction.
