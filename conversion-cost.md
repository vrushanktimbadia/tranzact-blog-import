If you are an accountant or finance manager, then knowing the conversion costs can help you accurately measure the production estimates. It also allows you to develop a product pricing model and the value of finished goods.

But, if you need a detailed idea about conversion costs, how they differ from prime costs, their examples, advantages, and others, then this is the right article for you. Let’s understand conversion costs better.

## What is Conversion Cost?
Conversion cost is the cost the company spends on unusual expenses and direct labour when turning raw materials into finished products. This [costing formula](/blogs/costing-methods) is used in cost accounting by those running manufacturing businesses or any company producing goods. It is used to derive the value of ending inventory and show it in the balance sheet.

## What Is The Conversion Cost Formula?
Calculating conversion costs helps the business to measure the exact value of its production processes and expenses. Here is the simple conversion cost formula.
Conversion Cost = Direct Labour Cost + Manufacturing Overhead Costs
It is the cost of labour and running costs, except for raw materials.
* Here, direct labour involves the money spent on those engaged in direct production.
* It includes salaries, wages of the employees or workers, pension funds, insurance of production staff, employee supervision, and more.
* Manufacturing overhead/running cost involves any necessary expenses to maintain the equipment used in the production.
* It includes electricity bills, depreciation, rent, plant insurance, maintenance of plants, repairs, and more.
Knowing what it will cost to turn [finished goods](/blogs/finished-goods) will help the manufacturers' product pricing.

## Types Of Conversion Costs
Most conversion costs are likely to be classified as manufacturing overhead, while others are in direct labour or the cost of regular working hours. Some of the conversion costs that the company may incur are-
* Factory or office rent
* Production Supervision
* Inspection expenses
* Machining
* Employees bonus
* Equipment depreciation
* Payroll taxes
* Salary to production staff
* Production utilities
* Factory Insurance
* Equipment maintenance like plant and machinery
* Small tools are charged to expense
* Factory supplies
* Employees benefits and more.

## Conversion Cost Examples
The examples of conversion cost will let you understand its calculation and usage more efficiently. Furthermore, it helps you to make favourable financial decisions that benefit you in the future.

The following are the examples to understand conversion costs-
Example-

XYZ Ltd Co. incurred the following expenses in December while producing 20,000 units. The expenses list for the same are-
* Electricity costs- Rs-10,000
* Transportation charges- Rs-25,000
* [Raw materials](/blogs/raw-materials-inventory)- Rs-20,000
* Assembly plant rent- Rs-35,000
* Direct labour costs- Rs-50,000

So, with the help of the formula,

Conversion cost = Direct labour + manufacturing expenses

Thus, Conversion Cost = Rs-50,000+ Rs (10,000 +25,000 +35,000)
=Rs 50,000+ 70,000
=Rs 120,000

Again, conversion cost per unit is the total conversion cost/no of units produced
=Rs. 120,000/20,000
= Rs. 6

 |
| Components  | Conversion costs include direct materials costs and manufacturing overheads. | The components of prime costs include direct labour and direct materials. |
| Example |An example of conversion cost includes manufacturing products. For example, in furniture, costs related to wages of labourers, wooden planks, and more. | If you consider furniture again, examples of prime cost include paints required for furniture, screws required to hold tight planks, wages of labourers, and more.  |
| Formula | Conversion cost= Direct labour cost + manufacturing overhead costs | Prime cost = Raw Materials + Direct Labour |
| Reason for Calculation  | The main aim of calculating prime costs is to know the maximum retail price for the company. | Prime cost is estimated to manage expenses incurred during the production cycle and bring efficiency. |
| The Essence Of Price | Conversion costs do not include direct material costs. | The prime costs cover the price of direct materials for their calculation |
| Presentation In The Cost Sheet | The calculation of conversions depends on the requirements of the managers and the company.  | It is calculated at the beginning of the cost sheet. |
