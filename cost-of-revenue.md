TL;DR: Cost of revenue shows the direct costs required to produce and deliver goods or services. For Indian SME manufacturers, tracking it clearly helps improve pricing, margins, and operational decisions.

## What Is Cost of Revenue?

Cost of revenue refers to the direct expenses a business incurs to produce goods or deliver services. These costs are closely tied to day-to-day operations and directly impact profitability and efficiency.

For manufacturers, cost of revenue helps reveal where money is actually spent on making and delivering products, not just selling them. This clarity supports better cost control and pricing decisions.

## How Cost of Revenue Works

Cost of revenue includes only costs that rise or fall with production or service delivery.

Key ideas:
- It captures direct production and delivery costs.
- It helps businesses understand true operational efficiency.
- It is used to calculate gross profit.
- It allows comparison with industry benchmarks.

In short, cost of revenue shows how efficiently a business converts effort into income.

## Formula and Calculation of Cost of Revenue

Cost of Revenue = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) + Additional Direct Costs

COGS includes raw materials, direct labour, and manufacturing overheads. Additional direct costs may include packaging, freight, or service delivery expenses.

This calculation gives a realistic view of the cost required to earn revenue.

## What Is Included in Cost of Revenue

### Direct Labour Costs
Wages and benefits of workers directly involved in production or service delivery.

### Raw Materials

### Manufacturing Supplies
Consumables such as lubricants and cleaning materials used in production.

## Cost of Revenue vs Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of revenue is broader than COGS.

- Cost of revenue includes all direct costs of producing and delivering goods or services.
- COGS focuses mainly on production costs.

Both are essential for understanding gross profitability, but cost of revenue provides a fuller picture.

- Factory rent and utilities.
- Shipping and distribution costs.
- Quality testing expenses.

Adding these together gives the total cost of revenue for the period.

## Cost of Revenue vs Operating Expense

Operating expenses include indirect costs such as administration, marketing, and office salaries.

Separating these helps businesses understand core operational efficiency.

## Managing Cost of Revenue
