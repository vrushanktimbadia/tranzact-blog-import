# Material Handling Equipment: Types, Use Cases, and Application

**TL;DR:** Material handling equipment helps Indian SME manufacturers move, store, and control materials safely and efficiently, reducing costs, wastage, and workplace risk while improving productivity.

## What Is Industrial Material Handling Equipment?

Material handling equipment refers to tools and machines used to move, store, control, and protect materials during manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution. These include manual tools, powered trucks, and automated systems that reduce human effort and error.

In Indian manufacturing setups, material handling equipment is commonly used in factories, warehouses, and commercial storage units to handle loading, unloading, shifting, and storage of materials at scale.

## Types of Material Handling Equipment

Material handling equipment is broadly classified into four categories based on function and level of automation.

### 1. Storage and Handling Equipment

Storage and handling equipment is used to store materials between production and distribution stages. These systems are typically static and non-automated.

Common examples include racks, shelves, drawers, and stacking frames. They help optimise floor space and safely store tools and materials.

### 2. Engineered Material Handling Systems

Engineered systems are automated solutions designed to transport, store, and retrieve materials with minimal manual intervention.

These systems support inventory tracking, high-volume movement, and consistent material flow. Typical examples include conveyor systems, robotic delivery systems, and automated storage and retrieval systems.

### 3. Industrial Material Handling Trucks

Industrial trucks are used to transport materials across short or long distances. They are categorised into stacking and non-stacking trucks.

Examples include hand trucks, pallet trucks, order pickers, forklifts, and side loaders. Each type is chosen based on load type, aisle width, and operational needs.

### 4. Bulk Material Handling Equipment

Bulk material handling equipment is designed for loose materials such as food grains, liquids, metals, or powders.

Common equipment includes stackers, hoppers, conveyor belts, and reclaimers. These systems enable controlled movement and storage of bulk materials at scale.

## Industry-Wise Usage of Material Handling Equipment

Different industries use material handling equipment based on their material type and operational complexity.

### Agriculture

Used for handling seeds, crops, fertilisers, and grains through equipment such as hoppers and grain elevators.

### Construction

Relies on forklifts, aerial lifts, and loaders to move heavy materials like cement, steel bars, and aggregates.

### Distribution

Uses stackers and automated guided vehicles to move finished goods efficiently before dispatch.

### Warehousing

Uses reach trucks, stackers, and storage systems to maximise space utilisation and improve picking efficiency.

### Manufacturing

Heavily dependent on pallet trucks, forklifts, and automated vehicles to move raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.

## Why Material Handling Equipment Matters

Material handling equipment improves productivity, safety, and cost control across manufacturing operations.

### Improved Productivity

Ensures smooth movement of materials between processes, reducing downtime and production bottlenecks.

### Reduced Wastage

Automation and controlled handling minimise human error and product damage.

### Better Space Utilisation

Optimised storage systems and side loaders help increase warehouse capacity.

### Lower Operating Costs

Faster, error-free handling reduces rework, wastage, and labour dependency.

### Improved Worker Safety

Reduces manual lifting and handling of heavy goods, lowering the risk of injuries.

## How to Choose the Right Material Handling Equipment

Selecting the right equipment depends on operational requirements and physical constraints.

### Material Type

Different materials such as solids, liquids, and gases require different handling mechanisms.

### Facility Layout

Equipment must suit available space, aisle width, and ceiling height.

### Budget

Total cost should include acquisition, maintenance, and operating expenses.

### Structural Compatibility

Equipment dimensions and load limits must match site conditions.

### Reliability and Support

Choose suppliers offering durable equipment with reliable after-sales support.
