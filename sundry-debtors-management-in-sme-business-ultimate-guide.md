**TL;DR:** Sundry debtors management helps SME businesses maintain healthy cash flow, working capital, and payment discipline by tracking receivables and automating follow-ups.

Effective management of sundry debtors supports businesses of all sizes to achieve financial stability, in order to pay off their debts or liabilities. This not only increases the value of your organization but also helps you to build cash liquidity. 

However, to achieve this you must maintain a healthy cash inflow system which broadly consists of two parts - cash sales and cash from sundry debtors. Cash sales aren't usually a large part of your cash inflow and therefore don't affect your liquidity position that much.

That isn't the case with sundry debtors as they make up for most of your cash inflow system. And managing this entire piece is what tends to get complicated as your business grows. This is why sundry debtors management systems were created. In this blog, we will deep dive into this subject and learn about all the various facets of the sundry debtors process.







## What Are Sundry Debtors?

But instead of making an upfront payment, he promises Mr. B that he will make the payment within 15 days from the date of purchase. Now as Mr. B accepts Mr. A's payment terms, the entire transaction between them stands to exist and therefore, gets completed. Now, instead of receiving a cash payment which would be a current asset, Mr. A becomes an active debtor to Mr. B's business. A group of such debtors is collectively referred to as sundry debtors.

## What Is Accounts Receivable?

Accounts receivable, also known as AR, are the sum total of money for goods or services delivered or used that are yet to be paid for by the various customers.

### Periodic follow-ups:

If a certain debtor has defaulted on the payment terms that were previously agreed upon, the software starts sending the debtor a bunch of follow-ups via phone calls and emails, urging them to clear their dues at the earliest in order to avoid relooking at the credit arrangement altogether.

This system collects and sorts all the data regarding each of your sundry debtors and helps you navigate what action you need to take to best safeguard your company and cash inflow.

This is another very important piece of the puzzle as it helps you minimize your losses when dealing with other companies or businesses. It also helps you to get complete clarity on the interest terms on late payments, discount options, and cheque dishonor-related fines.
