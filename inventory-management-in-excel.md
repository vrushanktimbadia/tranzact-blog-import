<img src="@/assets/img/Inventory_Management_Excel_Template.webp" alt="TranZact - Inventory Management Excel" loading="lazy">

Although MS Excel is a reasonably affordable tool for inventory management, it can be challenging to manage inventory with it depending on the complexity of operations. In an inventory management Excel sheet, organizations are required to manually track inventory daily. Due to this, they may often lose track of their inventory flow and related data. It is difficult to perform fully automated stock management in Excel. There is no functionality to create automated invoice and stock inventory management in Excel. This means that an MS Excel inventory management system is not a complete tool.

To achieve complete inventory control, SMEs can opt for suitable, cost-effective [inventory management software](/solutions/inventory-management-software) that is a good alternative to MS Excel. In addition to tracking functionality, it can also give you real-time reports.

## Inventory Management Software vs. Excel Inventory Management
Excel can take over several aspects of your inventory but you can not get the functionality of a [stock management software](/blogs/stock-management-system) in excel. Here is a detailed comparison of both the tools:

### 1. Time Efficiency
Excel’s manual spreadsheet models are time-consuming and difficult to update as you need to manually enter inventory-related data. Inventory management systems can save valuable time using barcodes to update inventory data automatically. These solutions help you to track incoming and outgoing stocks without manual dependency.

### 2. Multiple Channels
Many manufacturing companies depend on many sales channels, including physical stores, online channels, and distribution networks. With Excel, companies find it challenging to fulfill customer orders from various channels. Inventory management software solves this problem by integrating multiple channels for smooth [order fulfillment](/blogs/order-fulfillment).

### 3. Operational Visibility
MS Excel provides limited visibility into the movement of inventory items and stock levels. With automated inventory management solutions, SMEs can gain real-time visibility into their operations, including multiple [warehouses](/blogs/best-warehouse-management-software) across regions. Every incoming or outgoing inventory item can be automatically updated in the inventory system.

### 4. Cost Efficiency
Inventory management solutions also save costs. For example, automated inventory solutions let you store the right amount of inventory items as per need. Through real-time notifications, [inventory management tools](/blogs/inventory-management-tools) help you avoid overstock or understock inventory and prevent any production delays.

### 5. Customer Service
Excel does not provide on-demand customer support for inventory-specific issues that users may have. This can be a major drawback when it comes to SMEs adopting stock management. On the other hand, a software’s customer support team is always available to provide valuable suggestions and insights into improving inventory management.
