# Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Explained

**TL;DR:** Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) helps manufacturers decide how much to order each time so total inventory cost stays low. It balances ordering cost and holding cost to avoid overstocking or shortages.

## What is EOQ?

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a calculation used in inventory management to determine the optimal quantity of items to order at one time. The goal is to minimize the combined cost of ordering and holding inventory.

EOQ is also called optimum lot size or ideal order quantity.

## EOQ Formula

EOQ is calculated using three inputs: annual demand, ordering cost, and holding cost.

EOQ = √(2 × D × S / H)

Where:
- D = annual demand
- S = cost per order
- H = annual holding cost per unit

## EOQ Example

A business sells 10,000 units annually.
Ordering cost per order is ₹500.
Holding cost per unit per year is ₹200.

EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 500 / 200) ≈ 224 units

Ordering close to this quantity keeps total inventory cost optimal.

## Why EOQ is Important

EOQ helps businesses:
- Reduce excess inventory
- Lower ordering frequency costs
- Improve cash flow
- Avoid stockouts and overstocking

As order size increases, holding cost rises and ordering cost falls. EOQ finds the balance point.

## EOQ in Inventory Control

EOQ supports inventory control by defining how much to reorder and when. It applies to raw materials and finished goods.

Benefits include:
- Accurate reorder quantities
- Reduced storage and handling cost
- Better operational efficiency
- Improved profitability

## EOQ in Cost Accounting

In cost accounting, EOQ prevents understocking and overstocking.

Key cost components:
- Ordering cost = (D / Q) × S
- Holding cost per unit = i × C
- Annual holding cost = (Q / 2) × H
- Total cost = ordering cost + holding cost

EOQ is found by minimizing total cost.

## Challenges of EOQ

EOQ assumes stable demand and costs, which may not hold true in reality.

Common challenges:
- Manual or outdated data systems
- Seasonal demand variation
- Inventory shortages
- Assumption of constant demand

## Using EOQ Effectively

EOQ works best when demand and costs are tracked accurately. Automated inventory systems improve EOQ accuracy and usability.

## FAQs
