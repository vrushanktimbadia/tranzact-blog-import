## Where Do We Need State Code in GST?

As per the GST law, any business entity with different branches in some states contains only one type of GST identification number. For all legal and commercial purposes, a GST number is provided for transactions made around the business identity and concerned individuals.

The GST state code list is required for the following:

### 1. Goods and Services Tax Identification Number:
It starts with the code for a particular state. The two digits present in the first place are used to represent the code of the country.

### 2. Supply place and delivery zone:
It is essential to determine if the IGST number would be imposed and if SGST or CGSR is charged.
