# Cost Center: Definition, How It Works, and Examples

**TL;DR:** A cost center is a department or function that incurs costs but does not directly generate revenue. It helps businesses track expenses, improve accountability, and make informed financial decisions.

A cost center is a core concept in financial management. It helps companies monitor expenses, allocate resources, and understand how different parts of the organization consume money.

## Define Cost Center

A cost center is a department or unit within a company that does not directly bring in revenue but is essential for smooth operations. Its primary role is to manage and control costs within a defined budget.

Teams like HR, finance, or IT typically function as cost centers. Their managers are responsible for ensuring expenses stay within approved limits.

## Cost Center: An Overview

A cost center represents a specific area of a business that incurs expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, and maintenance. Even though it does not directly generate profits, it supports revenue-generating activities.

Each cost center is usually assigned a unique code. Costs are tracked against this code to compare actual spending with planned budgets and identify inefficiencies.

## Types of Cost Centers

### Operational Cost Center
Groups people, equipment, and activities by function but does not generate revenue.  
Example: IT department including staff, hardware, and software.

### Personal Cost Center
Focuses only on employee-related costs, excluding equipment or systems.  
Example: HR staff salaries without HR software costs.

### Machinery Cost Center
Tracks costs related to machines and equipment, excluding manpower.  
Example: Manufacturing plant machinery and maintenance.

### Locational Cost Center
Tracks expenses for a specific geographic location.  
Example: Regional operations office.

### Product Cost Center
Captures costs related to developing or producing a product, excluding sales costs.

### Project Cost Center
Tracks expenses for a specific project with a defined budget and timeline.  
Example: Warehouse construction project.

### Service Cost Center
