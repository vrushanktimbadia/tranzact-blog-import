<blog-image alt="TranZact - Stock Discrepancies" image="stock_discrepancies.webp"></blog-image>

Stock discrepancy refers to the difference between physical stock or inventory and the current inventory in records or systems. Accurate inventory is important for a successful organization, including businesses of all sizes and reach.

It is particularly effective in domains like e-commerce, retail, manufacturing of diverse products, etc. It is ideal for companies that deal with:
* diverse [SKUs](/blogs/what-is-sku)[ (stock-keeping units)](/blogs/what-is-sku),
* quick product transportation,
* last-moment deliveries, and
* ensuring error-free goods.

Such errors often increase the chance of inventory mismatches.

Small disparities can be easily addressed, unlike large-scale discrepancies that may result in widespread issues and long-term losses. Other damaging results include:
* stock buffering,
* loss of consumers,
* loss in sales,
* lack of consumer satisfaction, or return consumers.

Lastly, it is critical to discover the underlying reason for reducing stock errors, which might be more complex than correcting the issue. You can use a stock discrepancy report sample to understand stock errors better.

## Main Causes of Inventory Discrepancy

Inventory discrepancy or stock concerns arise from various technical or human faults. Understanding the cause behind an underlying error can help organizations and businesses better understand inventory:

Here are some of the key causes of discrepancy of stock -

### 1. Inventory Shrinkage

Inventory shrinkage happens when the number of stock goods is less than the number of records in the inventory recorded-keeping system.

Some reasons for this include:
* supplier theft,
* fraud,
* human error,
* eliminating defective products, and
* inside administrative mistakes.

Investing in solid safety precautions and workforce instruction is necessary to reduce wastage.

### 2. Poor Returned Product Management

Return management greatly impacts a company's balance sheet and revenue. It ensures the correct handling of returned goods, reduces stock discrepancies, guarantees proper programming, avoids harm, and improves inventory precision.

Due to the different processing of returned products, proper focus on timely refund processes can be difficult. Training workers is critical to maintaining that the inventory system accurately tracks the delivery and condition of returned products.

### 3. Inadequate Location

Stock shortages can occur due to misplaced inventory, which can occur due to improper accounting or identification. To overcome this issue, employee education is important.

If stock locations remain a leading cause of confusion, consider improving structure and categorization and introducing improved stock management for location.

### 4. Not Using Adequate Technology

Outdated machinery is often at fault for the majority of stock disparities. A simple inventory control system may offer accurate, complete, and current stock insights.

Switching to a complete system that solves current and potential [stock management](/blogs/stock-management-system) needs could be the most cost-effective investment for organizations.

### 5. Lost Inventory

Modern storage facilities mark and identify commodities on arrival using stock control systems. Employees handle many tasks, but robotic assistants can be employed in modern warehouses to improve the results.

Human errors, such as inaccurate material receipt and categorization, may lead to stock differences. Suppliers may also mistakenly deliver unauthorized materials, resulting in stock discrepancies.

### 6. Human Error

Human mistake is a key cause of inventory discrepancy in e-commerce, influencing supply chains from beginning to end.

To avoid errors, ensure employees understand inventory differences, follow standard operating procedures, and conduct regular audits.

Physical inventory counts are important in preventing the mix-up of similar components and identifying product differences.

### 3. Connect with Manufacturers

You must maintain broad communication channels with valuable suppliers in the inventory management process. Collaborate effectively to address issues, specifically regarding stock fluctuations.

Training suppliers' workforce can reduce stock-outs, overstocking, and poor quality (COPQ) costs.

### 4. Check Inwards and Outwards Stock Levels

The businesses must work to improve warehousing accuracy in inventory by establishing a careful and accurate inward and outward process. Some actions to maintain ideal [stock levels ](/blogs/minimum-stock-level)include double-checking supplier receipts and preventing discrepancies to prevent stock fluctuation.
