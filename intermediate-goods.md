TL;DR: Intermediate goods are inputs like raw materials or semi-finished items that are transformed into final products. They determine cost structures, value addition, and GDP treatment in manufacturing.

## What are Intermediate Goods?
Intermediate goods are raw materials or semi-finished products used in the production of other goods. They are not sold for direct consumption but are transformed into final outputs.

## How Intermediate Goods Work
They pass through multiple production stages, adding value at each step until a finished product is ready for sale.

## Categories of Intermediate Goods
- Internally consumed production inputs
- Inputs sold to other manufacturers
- Inputs used to create further intermediate goods

## Key Characteristics
- Consumed or transformed during production
- Demand depends on final goods demand
- Value is embedded in the final product

## Examples
Steel, glass, cotton, wheat, paint, hardware fittings, mechanical parts, and production-related services.

## Intermediate vs Final Goods
Classification depends on usage, not the item itself.

## Intermediate vs Capital Goods
Intermediate goods are consumed; capital goods enable production over time.

## Intermediate Goods and GDP
Excluded from GDP to prevent double counting.

## Managing Intermediate Goods
Effective tracking prevents stockouts and excess inventory.
