In this article, we'll take a look at the inventory-to-sales ratio and its importance for understanding inventory efficiency.

## What Is the Inventory to Sales Ratio?

The inventory-to-sale ratio evaluates a company's inventory levels in relation to the revenues it generates. The inventory-to-sale ratio compares the value of a company's [inventory](/blogs/inventory) to the cost of making or purchasing those products. The business calculates it depending on the prices of those products.

* A low inventory-to-sales ratio shows that sales are strong and inventory is low, indicating that the business is performing well.
* On the other hand, a high inventory-to-sales ratio suggests that stock is expanding rapidly compared to the rate at which products are moving off the shelves.

## Why Is the Inventory to Sales Ratio Significant?

The inventory-to-sale ratio is significant because it provides important insights into how well a business is functioning and how financially stable it is. Inventory is frequently among the largest expenditures for businesses and is a requirement for sales.

Hence the inventory-to-sales ratio is an important metric. Businesses sometimes want to sell their merchandise quickly, and knowing their inventory-to-sale ratio allows them to track their sales rate.

### When Is This Ratio Useful?

The retail inventory-to-sales ratio provides important information about a company's sales strategy, inventory practices, and methods of delivering finished goods to buyers or retail outlets. A good inventory-to-sale ratio is less than one, and companies often strive for a ratio between 0.17 and 0.25.

* The closer the ratio to zero, the better it is for a business because it indicates that sales and inventory are relatively low.
* When sales exceed the inventory cost, the business will likely produce money.
* If the ratio is significantly higher than 0.25, sales are undoubtedly insufficient.
* On the other hand, an extremely low ratio may signal that inventory is selling too quickly to meet demand, in which case the business may benefit from increasing output.

A company can get a strong insight into its selling patterns by watching its ratio over three to five years.

### Inventory to Sales Ratio Formula

The IS ratio can be calculated by dividing the average inventory by the net sales. A period's average stock can be calculated by adding the stock at the beginning of the period to the stock at the end and dividing it by two.

The net sales figure is the overall sales volume less the number of product returns. Income statements and balance sheets often contain the data needed to calculate these ratios. The sales-to-inventory ratio formula for an organization is as follows:

### Examples of Inventory-to-Sales Ratio Calculations

The inventory-to-sales ratio chart takes on multiple aspects depending on the industry. Looking at various instances can help with learning how to calculate the ratio. The ratio calculations for two hypothetical businesses are given below.

**Example 1:** Assume a company's inventory value is INR 500,000 at the beginning and INR 700,000 at the end of the month. The entire monthly sales of the company are INR 2,000,000.

(Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (500,000 + 700,000) / 2 = 1,200,000 / 2 = INR 600,000

(600,000 / 2,000,000) * 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30%

As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio in this case is 30%.

**Example 2:** A firm has an opening inventory value of INR 800,000 and a closing inventory value of INR 600,000. The period's total sales are INR 1,500,000.

Inventory Average = (800,000 + 600,000) / 2 = 1,400,000 / 2 = INR 700,000

Inventory-to-Sales Ratio = (700,000/1.5 million) * 100 = 0.4667 * 100 = 46.67%

As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio in this case is around 46.67%.
