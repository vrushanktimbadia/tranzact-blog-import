Business owners at Indian SME manufacturing companies often struggle with inefficient inventory management. This leads to high holding costs and frequent stockouts of important items. They face challenges in prioritizing inventory. This results in misallocated resources and operational inefficiencies. 

Inaccurate demand forecasting increases overstocking issues, tying up valuable capital in excess inventory. The lack of data-driven decision-making stops effective inventory investment and reordering strategies, compromising overall supply chain management. 

ABC Analysis in inventory management is a proven technique that businesses can use for [Inventory optimization](/blogs/inventory-optimization). In this blog post, we will talk about the importance of ABC Analysis in inventory management, the ABC technique and try to understand it with an example. We will also go through the advantages and disadvantages of ABC analysis and see how it plays an important role in inventory control.

## What is ABC Analysis in Inventory Management?
ABC Analysis is an [inventory management](/blogs/inventory-management) technique that helps businesses prioritize their inventory according to the importance of each item. This method organizes [inventory](https://letstranzact.com/blogs/inventory) into three categories - A, B, and C - based on their impact on the business.

The method is derived from the Pareto Principle, which states that 80% of effects come from 20% of the causes. To effectively manage your stock and resources while maximizing the benefit, you need to understand ABC analysis and how to implement it.

ABC Analysis helps to concentrate inventory management efforts on the most important items. This helps with informed decisions about [stock levels](/blogs/the-importance-of-accurate-inventory-levels), [ordering](/blogs/order-management), and stocking policies. Here is the ABC classification in inventory management:

* Class A items represent the most important and valuable items. This constitutes a small percentage of the total inventory.
* Class B items are less critical than Class A items. These account for a moderate percentage of both the total [inventory and sales](blogs/sales-and-inventory-management-system).
* Class C items are the least important. They include a large percentage of the total inventory.

## How to Perform ABC Analysis?
Below is a step-by-step process for performing an ABC Analysis:

**1. Gather Data:** Collect the necessary data for each item in your inventory.

**2. Define Objective:** Define the purpose of the ABC analysis for your organization's needs.

**3. Calculate Impact:** For each item, calculate its impact on sales as a percentage using the formula:

**% Impact = {(annual item cost) / (total spend on all items)} X 100**

**4. Sort Items:** Rank each item based on the calculated sales impact percentages.

**5. Define Criteria:** Set criteria for categories A, B, and C based on 80%, 20%, and 10% of the spend or sales value, respectively.

**6. Categorize Items:** Apply the percentage cut-offs to the sorted list to determine which items fall into Class A, B, and C.

**7. Review Classification:** Make sure the classification accurately reflects the importance of each item to your business.

**8. Implement Strategies:** Develop and implement strategies for each class of items and regularly review their effectiveness.

## What to do next after ABC Inventory Analysis?
After implementing ABC Analysis in inventory management, the next steps include:

**1. Adjust Strategies:** Create specific rules and procedures for ordering, stocking, and managing items in each category to optimize resources and reduce costs.

**2. Set Service Levels:** Give higher service levels to Class A items, moderate service levels to Class B items, and lower service levels to Class C items.

**3. Track KPIs:** Make key performance indicators (KPIs) for each category to measure how well your inventory management strategies are working and review them regularly.

**4. Schedule Cycle Counts:** Perform regular [inventory counts](/blogs/inventory-cycle-count), more often for Class A items, to keep accurate records and quickly find any discrepancies.

**5. Update Classifications:** Review and update your ABC classifications as market conditions, customer preferences, and business priorities change.

**6. Use Technology:** Use [inventory management software](/solutions/inventory-management-software) and tools to automate and simplify ordering, tracking, and analyzing inventory data.

**7. Train Staff:** Make sure your team understands the importance of ABC Analysis and is trained to manage inventory effectively.

## Example of ABC Analysis Calculation
Let’s understand the method with an ABC analysis example. Suppose you run a factory and have 5 products in your inventory. The annual sales and cost per unit for each product are listed in a table.

| Product | Annual Sales (units) | Cost per unit (₹/unit) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 5000 | 10 | 
| B | 4000 | 20 | 
| C | 3000 | 15 | 
| D | 2000 | 25 | 
| E | 1000 | 30 | 

To calculate the annual usage value of each product, you multiply the annual sales by the cost per unit:

| Product | Annual Sales (units) | Cost per unit (₹/unit) | Annual usage value (₹) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 5000 | 10 | 50,000 | 
| B | 4000 | 20 | 80,000 | 
| C | 3000 | 15 | 45,000 | 
| D | 2000 | 25 | 50,000 | 
| E | 1000 | 30 | 30,000 | 

Next, you arrange the products in descending order based on their annual usage value:

| Product | Annual Sales (units) | Cost per unit (₹/unit) | Annual usage value (₹) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B | 4000 | 20 | 80,000 | 
| A | 5000 | 10 | 50,000 | 
| D | 2000 | 25 | 50,000 | 
| C | 3000 | 15 | 45,000 | 
| E | 1000 | 30 | 30,000 | 

Finally, you divide the products into categories as mentioned above.
* Product B would be in the A category
* Products A and D would be in the B category
* The rest would be in the C category.

You can use the allocation to prioritize the resources with the highest annual usage value, which in this example would be product B. We hope this example of ABC analysis in inventory management  explains the concept well. Now let’s understand how to implement it.

## How to Implement ABC Inventory Management?
To implement ABC inventory management effectively, follow these steps:

* Calculate the annual consumption value for each item in your inventory.
* Categorize items into A, B, and C groups.
* Determine the percentage of total inventory value for each group.

* **Better cost control:** It helps in reducing [inventory costs](/blogs/inventory-cost) by highlighting products that contribute the most to inventory holding costs.
* **Increased profitability:** It helps businesses in reducing costs and improving profitability and sales. It also reduces the risk of [obsolete inventory](/blogs/obsolete-inventory).
* **Improved Negotiation:** Since Class A items generate 70% to 80% of a company's revenue, it is important to negotiate favorable terms for these products.
* **Improved understanding:** It offers a thorough understanding of inventory, helping businesses find improvement areas and focus on valuable products.
* **Efficient allocation:** It facilitates ongoing assessment of resource distribution to guarantee that Class A items correspond with customer demand.
