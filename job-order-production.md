## Job Order Production: Successful Production Outsourcing
Job order production is a [manufacturing process](/blogs/types-of-manufacturing-processes) that is used to create special products for specific customer orders. Each product helps individual customer needs. Job Order Production simplifies manufacturing by expertly outsourcing specific tasks, improving overall production success in the following ways:
1. Tailored Solution: Businesses can produce custom-made products. This approach makes sure that each order is perfect and meets the customer's unique needs.

2. Cost Efficiency: It reduces excess [inventory](/blogs/inventory-item) and storage costs. Successful job order production can lead to cost savings. Manufacturers can reduce operational costs, such as labour, equipment, and facility expenses, ultimately increasing their revenue.

3. Scalability: It allows manufacturers to adapt to changing market demands. Businesses can scale production up or down without the burden of maintaining in-house production facilities.

4. Expertise Access: Production outsourcing gives manufacturers access to industry expertise and experience. This valuable knowledge can improve product quality. This gives outsourcing manufacturers a competitive edge in their market.

5. Reduced Waste: Job order production typically produces goods in smaller batches, which leads to less waste in comparison to mass [production methods](/blogs/types-of-production-planning). This waste reduction is good for the environment and economy.

6. Core Strengths: Job order production lets businesses focus on their core strengths, such as marketing, sales, and product development while leaving the [manufacturing](/blogs/what-is-manufacturing) to the experts. This concentration on core strengths can lead to overall business growth and profit

The following list will give an idea about different production planning methods:

| Production Planning Method | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Master Schedule | A plan based on a comprehensive overview of production needs. | 
| Batch Production | Producing items in groups or batches, often for efficiency. | 
| Job Order Production | Customizing products for specific orders. | 
| Process-Based Learning | Focusing on step-by-step processes for efficient production. | 
| Lean Production | Reducing waste and increasing efficiency in operations. | 
| Just-in-Time (JIT) | Producing goods as needed to reduce inventory waste. | 

## Job Order Production System

Job order production is a [manufacturing process](/blogs/types-of-manufacturing-processes) that is the complete opposite of mass manufacturing.  Mass manufacturing produces identical goods in big quantities. In job order production, every product is different.

## Advantages Of Job Order Production
Job Order Production offers more flexibility, low cost, exact budgeting, and better manufacturing processes. Here are some key advantages:

### 1. Sub-Processes for All Goods
Job order productions help to add sub-processes to each master [Bill of Material (BOM)](/blogs/types-of-bom). One can manage semi-finished goods by optimizing the production process.

### 2. Define Routing Tasks
Businesses can specify operations like cutting, machining, or finishing within each [BOM](/blogs/how-to-make-a-bom). With this level of specificity, one can be confident of quality.

This makes sure every stage of the [production process](/blogs/production-planning-and-control) is clear-cut. It also makes sure that the job order production is perfect.

### 3. Efficient Work Order Management
Most job order productions make creating work orders simple. This way, a business owner has total control over one's production schedule.

Businesses can even turn a single or a group of work orders into a job order production. This in turn will reduce the job order costing calculating unit product cost.

### 4. Quality Assurance
Job order productions give quality delivery the top priority. It first updates the number of complete items in [inventory](/blogs/inventory-records). Then, businesses can collect the goods' testing data.

Businesses can make sure of the quality of the products before delivering them to clients.

## Job Order Production Examples
To see the impact of job order production, let's look at a few examples:

### 1. Custom Furniture Manufacturing

Think of a business that produces upscale furnishings. They get requests for one-of-a-kind furniture with specific style, size, and material recommendations.

They can make these pieces according to customer orders, providing furniture tailored to their client's preferences and requirements.

### 2. Aerospace Component Manufacturing

In the aerospace sector, accuracy is important. [Orders](/blogs/order-fulfillment) for specialized items like engines or landing gear, are put in place with manufacturers.

Job order manufacturers make sure that these parts follow strict quality and safety standards. This, in turn, makes sure of air travel security.

## 3. Mechanical Tools and Supplies
Consider a business that produces specialized mechanical tools and equipment. Customers place orders for specific tools with unique features. The manufacturer produces these tools according to the customer's requirements, making sure they meet quality and standards.

## 4. Electrical and Electronics
In the field of electrical and electronics, job order production is common. Businesses receive orders for customized electronic components or devices. They manufacture these items according to the customer's specifications, making sure they function correctly and follow safety standards.

These examples show how job order production can tailor products to individual customer needs, ensuring quality and satisfaction.
