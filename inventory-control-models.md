## What Is the Inventory Management Model?
Inventory control models are methods used by businesses to find the best quantity and timing for stock reordering. This helps to minimize costs and meet demand in time. They help in balancing ordering, holding, and stockout costs to make [inventory management](/blogs/inventory-management) efficient. Using models of [inventory control](/blogs/inventory-control-6-best-techniques-to-follow) you can reduce operational expenditures and storage fees to save your company money.

## What Are the Three Most Common Inventory Control Models?
Each inventory model uses a different method to figure out how much inventory you need. Here are the three inventory control models often used by Indian SME manufacturers:

### 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
[Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)](/blogs/eoq) is an inventory management technique that tells you how many inventory units to order to reduce costs based on your company's holding and ordering costs and demand rate. But, the EOQ model of inventory control makes assumptions that won't apply to every business. It assumes that your rate of demand, purchasing expenses, and inventory unit pricing are stable.

**Here is how to calculate your EOQ:**

Economic Order Quantity = square root of [2(setup cost x demand rate] / Production cost
Or
EOQ = square root of (2DS/H)​​

* D is the demand in units
* S is the order cost per purchase order.
* H is the holding costs per unit

The EOQ number is not useful if you frequently experience fluctuation in your inventory or order quantity.

### 2. Inventory Production Quantity
This Economic Production Quantity, or EPQ, tells you how many items you have to order for your company in a single batch to cut down on setup and holding expenses. It is based on the idea that each order is delivered to your company by your supplier in pieces rather than as a whole product.

This model might be a good fit for your company if you place inventory orders from suppliers in pieces rather than in bulk or if the demand for your products is steady over time.

### 3. ABC Analysis
[ABC Analysis](/blogs/abc-analysis-in-inventory-management) is used alongside other inventory management models. In this, your inventory is arranged according to its importance using the ABC model of inventory control. A manufacturer’s stock is divided into group A, group B, or group C. You decide which category to assign inventory to with the help of the Pareto Principle.

| Category | Description | Percentage of Stock | Percentage of Income | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Inventory with high value and importance, accounting for 20% of the stock and 70% of income | 20 | 70 | 
| B | Inventory with moderate value and significance, accounting for 30% of the stock and 25% of income | 30 | 25 | 
| C | Inventory with low value and income contribution, accounting for 50% of the stock and 5% of income. | 50 | 5 | 

Category A stock is subject to strict ordering rules because of its high value and contribution to overall revenue. Category B inventory is less important to the business. Despite being the majority of the stock, category C inventory makes the least revenue and therefore requires the least attention.

## Other Inventory Management Models
In addition to the above three, there are various types of inventory models in operations management that are useful for businesses. Some of the most common inventory management models are:

### 1. Fixed Reorder Quantity System
This model [replenishes the inventory](/blogs/stock-replenishment) to a required level with fresh orders. The system depends on the demand and an alarm alerts when the level of reordered inventory drops below a fixed quantity. A reorder point is a specific level of inventory, after which restocking is requested.

### 2. Fixed Reorder Period System
This is a model for [managing inventories](/blogs/inventory-manage-process), in which an alert is generated after each fixed time period. Based on the alert, orders are generated to refill the stock to the required level based on demand. In this case, [restocking inventory](/blogs/inventory-restocking) is a continuous interaction carried out after each specified period.

The most common inventory control methods are ABC Analysis, [Just In Time (JIT)](/blogs/just-in-time), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Safety Stock, First In, First Out (FIFO) and Last In, First Out (LIFO), Batch Tracking, and Perpetual Inventory System.

### 8. What is EOQ in inventory control?
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) in inventory control refers to the ideal order quantity a company should purchase to minimize its inventory costs, such as holding costs, shortage costs, and order costs.
