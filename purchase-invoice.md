## When Should You Use Purchase Invoice?
A purchase invoice serves as a record of the transaction and provides proof of the sale. It also mentions the price that the buyer has agreed to pay so that there is no confusion after the sale is complete. Therefore, a purchase invoice acts as an important reference for accounting purposes, including inventory management, financial reporting, and tax compliance.

After preparing and checking thoroughly, send the invoice to your customer via mail, email, fax, or hand delivery depending on your business practices and your customer’s preferences. Once it is sent, check with the buyer whether he has received it or not. Once the client confirms receiving the invoice, you can start following up on the due payment.

## Purchase Invoice vs Sales Invoice
There is a common confusion but purchase and sales invoice are not the same. Although sales invoice and purchase invoice are closely related, they have complementary roles in business transactions.

**Purchase Invoice:**
* **Issued By:** Vendor or seller.
* **Recipient:** Buyer or purchaser.
* **Purpose:** Requests payment from the buyer for goods or services delivered.
* **Usage:** Confirms the completion of a sale and serves as proof of the transaction for the buyer.

**Sales Invoice:**
* **Issued By:** Vendor or seller.
* **Recipient:** Customer or buyer.
* **Purpose:** Documents the sale and requests payment for goods or services provided.
* **Usage:** Used by the seller to record revenue and by the buyer as a record of the purchase.

### Purchase Invoice vs Sales Invoice Differences
Now let's understand the difference between sales invoice and purchase invoice:

* **Perspective:** A purchase invoice is viewed from the buyer's perspective as a record of what they owe. A sales invoice is viewed from the seller's perspective as a record of what they are owed.
* **Function:** Both documents serve as official records of a transaction but cater to different sides of the transaction process—buying versus selling.

Overall, a purchase invoice from one company is a sales invoice from another company, depending on which side of the transaction you are looking at.

## What Is a Purchase Order?
A [purchase order](/blogs/purchase-order) (PO) is a commercial document prepared by businesses to place an order for inventory or raw materials. It is sent by the buyer to the supplier, distributor, or manufacturer for official order placement. It has the details of all the requirements of the buyer i.e. all the products and services.

The buyers create a PO after discussing all the terms, and the agreement is the formal document of the same. Later, when it is sent to the seller, he can accept it or reject it. To accept it, he needs to sign it or send a formal acceptance email or letter.

Once the seller acknowledges the order, and both parties sign it, it becomes a legal contract and becomes a purchase contract. In the case of long-term agreements, a contract is used and they can be renewed, as per the need.

**Trivia:** Do you know bought of meaning on invoice? "Bought of" means the seller or vendor from whom the goods or services were purchased. It's an older term that means the buyer bought items from the named seller. Modern invoices use terms like "Supplier" or "Vendor" instead. This helps with clarity and aligns with current business practices.

## What Is Included in a Purchase Order?
A purchase order includes the contact information of both parties(buyer and seller), shipment address, product stock-keeping unit ([SKU](/blogs/what-is-sku)), item description, quantity, price, billing address, tax details, terms and conditions, delivery date, and payment due date.

Before you send it to the vendor, always double-check it. Check if the pricing, address, and payment terms are correct or not. You must also re-check if the calculated tax and discounts are accurate.

## Importance of Purchase Order
A purchase order is an important document for both business dealing and bookkeeping purposes. It is important in case any dispute arises because they are legally binding. For example, if the goods delivered are not as per order, or payment is not made by the buyer, suitable legal action can be taken. In other words, it acts as a safeguard for both parties.

Secondly, they can be used to keep track of business transactions. By keeping track of the order quantity, the buyer can ask for bulk discounts from the vendor. Vendors, on the other hand, know who are the top clients and offer them better service for long-term business relations.

* **Details:** Both documents contain the details of the items purchased, such as quantity, price, tax, due amount, delivery method, and payment method. They also share the company name, customer name, address, and contact details.

## Why Do Companies Use Both Purchase Invoices and Purchase Orders?

**Purchase Orders (POs):**
