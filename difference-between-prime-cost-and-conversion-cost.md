The comparison of prime costs vs. conversion costs is very useful in manufacturing industries to figure out expenses in each process and calculate accurate costs of the finished goods. This helps manufacturers set selling prices of finished goods that can be profitable for their businesses. 

Many business owners and managers struggle with differentiating between prime costs and conversion costs. This confusion can result in inaccurate pricing, budget overruns, and problems in production

Manufacturing companies may find themselves underestimating the actual production expenses or misallocating resources. This will eventually negativevly impact profitability and scalability. By comparing prime vs conversion cost, small-scale businesses find areas that cause extra expenses to reduce waste and improve their [production management](/solutions/production-management-software) and financial management.

In this blog post, we will learn about both prime and conversion costs, including their formula and examples, and understand their differences. You can use this comparison of prime costs vs. conversion costs to improve cost calculations and invest your money wisely in your manufacturing operations.

## Understanding Prime Costs
Prime cost is the expense directly involved in manufacturing [finished goods](/blogs/finished-goods). It helps manufacturers calculate the basic costs of certain finished goods and set profitable prices. 

The prime cost includes direct material and direct labour required to manufacture certain products. Prime cost does not include overhead costs like electricity bills and other utilities needed in the manufacturing processes.

The calculation of prime cost does not provide the total [production costs](/blogs/production-costs) for finished goods. You can calculate prime cost to find out how much you spend on raw materials and workers directly involved in manufacturing finished goods. 

You can use a simple prime cost formula to improve your cost calculations, which is given below:

**Prime cost = Direct material costs + Direct labour costs**

Read here [What Is Prime Cost?](/blogs/prime-cost)

After learning about the prime cost meaning and its formula, let’s understand this with an example of prime cost.
Suppose you own a manufacturing business that makes machinery gears.

* You spend Rs.500 on raw materials to make one gear.
* The direct labour cost is Rs. 300 to make the gear according to the required standards.
Using the above-mentioned prime cost method formula to calculate direct expenses for manufacturing one gear.

**Prime cost = Rs.500 (Direct materials cost) + Rs.300 (Direct labor cost) = Rs.800**

Your prime cost to manufacture one gear is Rs.800.

## Understanding Conversion Costs
Conversion cost is the money you spend to convert raw materials into finished goods. The conversion cost include direct labor and overhead expenses involved in manufacturing processes. Conversion cost does not include the prices of raw materials used to manufacture finished goods.

The calculation of conversion cost helps you find out overhead expenses like electricity and gas bills, factory supplies, rents, inventory [holding costs](/blogs/holding-costs), etc, involved in manufacturing finished goods. Using a simple conversion cost formula can improve your costing process and help you set profitable prices for finished goods.

Here is the conversion cost equation to improve your calculation:

**Conversion costs = Direct labour costs + Manufacturing overhead expenses**

After learning about the conversion cost meaning and its formula, let’s understand it with a practical example of conversion cost.
Suppose you own a manufacturing business that makes ceiling fans.
* Your total overhead costs are Rs.400, whether related to electricity or machine maintenance.
* You also pay Rs.100 to the labour to make one fan.
Now, we will use the formula to calculate conversion costs.

**Conversion Costs = Rs.100 (Direct labor cost) + Rs.400 (Overhead expenses) = Rs.500**

Your conversion cost to manufacture one ceiling fan is Rs.500.

## Key Differences Between Prime Costs And Conversion Costs
When you understand the difference between prime cost and conversion cost, you can easily calculate the prices of your finished goods. Let’s learn about the key differences.
