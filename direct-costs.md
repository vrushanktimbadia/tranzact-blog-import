With efficient [management of direct costs](/blogs/job-costing), any business can decrease overall costs and increase its sales and, therefore, profits. In this article, you will learn more about Direct costs, their types, and how it benefits businesses to become more efficient and profitable.

## What Is a Direct Cost?
In the production process, a direct cost refers to a price attached directly to the item. Direct costs include direct labour, direct materials, and overhead costs. It is important to understand the difference between direct and indirect costs to effectively manage production costs.

Direct costs are often variable, affecting [production levels](/blogs/production-planning) such as inventory. Initial direct cost may be a service, a product, or a department that initially defines the cost. A business needs to link the expense to a specific cost object, such as a product or project, to qualify as a direct cost in healthcare or direct costs in accounting.

For example, if a clothing company purchases fabric to make shirts, it's a direct cost because it relates to the shirts. Direct costs are mostly variable compared to indirect costs for most industries.

## Understanding Direct Costs
Direct costs are generally variable. But some direct costs are stable, called fixed costs, and others change depending on the variety of product and market factors.

For example, the price of a vacuum cleaner for a [manufacturing](/blogs/manufacturing-cost) plant may vary depending on the market cost of that product. A direct cost like labour charge for an hourly employee may also vary as their timetable might alter.

## Direct Cost Examples
Here are some examples of Direct costs in a business.

### 1. Labor
Daily labour charges are usually hourly wages, which can be variable. Labour is usually a direct cost if it alters depending on the [production line](/blogs/assembly-line). It might be indirect if the wage stays consistent in any business scenario, for example, salaried employees.

### 2. Commissions
Commission related to a sale is also a form of direct cost. They are directly connected to a specific object. For example, if an employee sells a bike and receives a commission, the payment is a direct cost in connection with that bike.

### 3. Raw materials
[Raw materials](/blogs/raw-materials-inventory) are also examples of direct costs as they are directly connected to the production of a specific product. It includes all sorts of production materials, but general supplies like pens and pencils might come under the indirect costs.

### 4. Equipment
Any equipment you manufacture products or perform customer services is typically a direct cost. Machines you might operate in a manufacturing facility also count as direct costs.

### 5. Transportation
If you pay money to shift specific materials or finished goods, it's likely a direct cost. It includes the price of shipping materials from the production facility and transportation between production and sales sites.

### 6. Fuel and some utilities
A gas-powered sawmill can count gasoline as a direct cost of making wood products. Costs associated directly with a cost object may be called direct costs. Therefore fuels are direct costs.

## Direct vs. Indirect Costs
Direct costs are straightforward to determine the cost for the object. For example, if a toy takes 3 hours to make and each labourer gets paid 10 rs for an hour, the labour charge for each toy is 30 rs.

However, indirect costs are not directly related to products as such. A business pays electricity bills, maintenance charges, and rent for workshops, which are not explicitly connected to the product but still contribute to [production](/blogs/production-costs). Such costs are called indirect costs.

## Fixed vs. Variable
As mentioned, Direct costs are not always fixed, as their unit cost may vary over time or depending on the quantity utilized.
* Materials used to make the product, such as wood or gasoline, can be directly related but do not contain a fixed amount.
* The quantity of the supervisor's salary or labour charge is known.
* But the unit production level costs are variable and based on sales and market conditions.

It makes fixed and variable costs two forms of direct costs.

## Inventory Valuation Measurement
Direct costs require strict management of [inventory](/blogs/inventory) valuation when inventory is bought using various payments. As the item is made, the material price must be connected directly to the item.

Direct costs also include the cost of raw materials and labour that are used to manufacture the product. Indirect costs include overhead costs, such as the cost of electricity, rent, and insurance, which are necessary to keep the business running but are not directly related to the product.

The direct cost formula includes direct materials and direct labour costs. When these two are added together it makes the direct cost.
Direct Materials + Direct Labor = Direct Cost
