## **What Are Sundry Creditors?**

Sundry creditors is a term used to describe individuals or businesses that provide goods or services on a credit basis. A business that makes use of this facility and takes goods or services from another business on credit, will refer to the provider of these goods or services as sundry creditors.

* Patel Pipes has dealt with Shah Enterprises a lot in the past and conducts ongoing business with them, hence extends them a line of credit frequently.
* Due to their trust-based relationship, Patel Pipes gives Shah Enterprises 2 months of credit period.
* This means that the payment from Shah Enterprises is now due on 1st May 2023.
